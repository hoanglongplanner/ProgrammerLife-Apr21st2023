# NOTE

C programming language does not have string variable, the only option is use char array variable

```
EXAMPLE: char str_example[] = "Hello World";
```

- Avoid assigning value to that array, the variable is designed to dynamically change it array side detected
- and avoid the headache of counting each character in string
